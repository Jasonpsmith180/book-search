# Book Search

## Description
Everybody can enjoy a good book, so I made an app to search and save books thanks to the Google Books API and the MERN stack.

A user can input a book title and see books related to their search terms.
Then the user will then be able to see a description of the book, the authors, and even save the book for later if they are logged in to the site.

The site is published at [Book Seach Engine](https://floating-reef-60803.herokuapp.com/).
